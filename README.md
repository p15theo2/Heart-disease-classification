Classifying heart disease patients using python,jupyter notebook,matplotlib and other tools.

Made for a university project.

The current repository contains all the code i used to test my techniques(cleaning,clasyfing etc) 
Only the code/parameters/techniques which had the best results(accuracy etc) made it to the final notebook .
